** Grading
*** Final Exam
    The final exam will be "take-home", and be made available by 6pm on

** Readings
  - "Hansen" refers to Gary Hansen's [[https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics.pdf][Econometrics Textbook]].
  - Unresolved references of the form "cite:foo84" or similar are keys
    with values that can be looked up in
    [[file:are212.bib][are212.bib]].  This last is a bibtex database which

*** Learning goals for this series of discussion sections
     - Build off of skills we developed with R to provide a basic familiarity of coding in Python (and deepen your overall understanding of coding for econometrics in the process)
     - Move from (potentially) no previous Python experience to being able to follow lecture applications and engage in bcourses discussions via Python

*** GSI expectations for the rest of the semester
     - See the [[https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1487913/files/folder/DiscussionSectionBen?preview=76549701][Discussion Section Syllabus]] for general information.
     - Office Hours are going to continue to be by appointment, and primarily via email.
